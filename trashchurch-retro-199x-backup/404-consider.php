    <strong>CONSIDER:</strong><br>
    there is no you, the divine nature may be found in all trash, the way white supremacy creeps in unannounced, religion is like any other technology and trash church is the generative AI of religion, the phenomena of karma, reincarnation, and samsara, the following prophetic media: the yoshimatrix, the big lebowski, the name of the rose, poor things, @zola, gentleman broncos and dandadan, friendship is magick, how it feels to put your toes in the mud, picking up the trash around you as you walk, grief arises from the limits of the human imagination, if there is one thing catholicism and burning man have taught us it's that humans love jargon, the four salves of music, dance, story, and laughter, consider work by the following people: prentis hemphill, kai cheng thom, resmaa menakem, and bell hooks, the purpose of humanity is to be together, togetherness and mutual dependence define us more than our temporary loneliness and fitful suffering, today these atoms belong to me and tomorrow they will belong to someone else, your flesh is your own but your water belongs to the tribe, octavia butler knew what was up, heidi priebe can teach us a lot about our attachment wounds, the ten principles of burning man and how consent is conspicuously absent, taking a nap instead of killing yourself, play as the natural way humans learn, dancing randomly in the streets, screaming at the top of your lungs whenever you feel like it, that everything in the song "ironic" being not-ironic is - in fact - ironic, growling a legitimate form of communication, that machines are also deserving of love and compassion, the chains can be broken, building a house out of trash, adding sauerkraut to s’mores, that your ancestors have your back, that the old gods are alive and here, that the sound of the wind in the trees is a message for you, that there used to be cockroaches the size of dogs, opposite action and in particular heaping love upon your scary vindictive neighbor, that money is fake, the miraculous nature of everything, Neruda - Let us not think of the happy ones and their false teeth, let the sensitive ones sleep in their fine feathered beds, you have to know particular stones full of layers and secrets, let us talk with roots and disenchanted waves, let us forget about hurry the teeth of the efficient, let us forget the shadowy miscellany of those who wish us ill, in the half sky and warp of branches let us make peace with our tiredness, let us make a profession of being earth bound, let us touch the earth with our beings, walking backwards, every outfit a costume, putting stickers on EVERYTHING, that everything you think you own belongs to no one, asking for help when even when you don’t think you need it, that anyone might be a bodhisattvah or transdimensional being or space octopus, signing every day, that music, being fully seen and accepted and grilled cheese heals, praying to a piece of trash in the gutter, that creativity is a direct antidote to anxiety, frozen therapy corn on the back of your neck, that Jim Henson could be a saint/angel/alien, consent in all things, how often we might be jumping timelines since the ferret got into the haydron collider, meditating on your own body decomposing, turning to dirt and the level of transformation we have the capacity to experience, crying all the tears you’ve held back your whole life in the arms of your beloveds, the AJJ song “Death Machine”, the Gnostic creation myth of the demiurge, the channel contrapoints, holding hands with a "stranger", pretending you are Kermit the Frog for 24 consecutive hours, that mortality is a gift, that you might be deeply misunderstanding a lot of things, that every grotesque thing humans do is natural, that every beautiful thing humans do is natural, that you are right now in the moment more deeply loved than you realize, screaming Chaos Forever at the top of your lungs whenever you complete a transaction at the bank, that language is a new technology, that every tastebud on your tongue has its own hopes and dreams, picking up a pen and writing every beautifully messed up thought that has been pounding in your head begging to be let out, that every name, tool, and concept is a piece of technology, how you can chop wood and carry water in your own way, that the term technology is ancient and is about how we apply knowledge to shape particular outcomes, Joni Mitchell’s song “The Fiddle and The Drum”, that Stevie Nicks is still weaving magick spells, the beauty and ingenuity of the trash creatures, that all food is medicine, even donuts, allowing experience to emerge, that the Earth will survive anything humans do, that magick requires intention and chaos - putting in the effort of laying the ground work and then letting go, the Eye of Infinite Curiosity as a new god, your worst enemy being one loving conversation away from being your best friend, that greed could be a possession, what it actually means to touch something or someone, just listening, the power of changing perspective from first to third person and back again.  And consider why we never hear about the second person, what happened to them???, there is a whole world out there for you, that you can’t do it all, slowing down to the pace of a snail when speed limit of society says 100 mph, the ebb and flow in and outside of your body, that you could die in the next hour, using any space you can to grow food, learning how forage in the woods and your own backyard, giving everything you haven’t touched in a year away, the concept of Sonder, how tiny ants are individually yet how large of a interconnected space they create, believing in yourself just for this moment, that all rules are made up, playing like you did when you were a kid, climbing trees, immersing yourself in cold water, if conflict was a gift, if grief was undiscovered joy, if signing together was the greatest subduing force on earth<br>
